# Loan Data Analysis Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview
**Problem Statement:**
Traditional loan data analysis methods lack depth and interactivity, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Static reports fail to provide a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. This project addresses these limitations by developing advanced, interactive dashboards for enhanced loan data analysis.

**Objective:**
To create a suite of interconnected dashboards that deliver dynamic and comprehensive insights into loan data, empowering decision-makers with actionable intelligence. These dashboards provide a holistic perspective on lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics.
